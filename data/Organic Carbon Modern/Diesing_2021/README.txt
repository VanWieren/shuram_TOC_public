Spatially predicted sedimentation rates, organic carbon densities and organic carbon accumulation rates in the North Sea and Skagerrak

The dataset contains spatially predicted linear sedimentation rates, organic carbon densities, organic carbon accumulation rates and the 
associated uncertainties in the predictions of surficial seafloor sediments in the North Sea and Skagerrak. The results are presented as 
geo-referenced floating-point TIFF-files with a spatial resolution of 500 m and Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection as spatial reference.

The following geoTIFF files are included in the dataset:

1. SedRate_quantrf_mean.tif: Linear sedimentation rate (cm/yr) based on 210Pb measurements
2. SedRate_quantrf_tot.unc.tif: Total uncertainty (cm/yr) of sedimentation rate predictions
3. OCdensity_quantrf_mean.tif: Organic carbon densities (kg/m3)
4. OCdensity_quantrf_tot.unc.tif: Total uncertainty (kg/m3) of organic carbon density predictions
5. OCAR.tif: Organic carbon accumulation rates (g/(m2yr))
6. OCAR_tot.unc.tif: Total uncertainty in the organic carbon accumulation rate calculations
